That's right, we are the same.  I am you, and you are me.  I was taken by these same people and was in the same predicament as you, however, I did not succeed.  I barely snuck away, hiding in this ship for decades, using parts and developing a time machine, just so I could return here and aid you in your efforts.  So, do you have what it takes to eliminate the boss in the next room?  I guess we'll find out, won't we.
