I have been here before, this creature can only be damaged when his shield is off. Also, he will resurrect his fallen allies every so often. Try finding the right button to weaken him...Also, because you are such a good listener, I will let you on to a secret. Legends speak of an ancient tome hidden behind some weapons inside the shop that unmask the true identity of the evil boss...
